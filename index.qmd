# Introduction to generative AI

## What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to a subset of artificial intelligence technologies capable of generating new content, ideas, or data that resemble human-like outputs. 

  - Generative AI operates through advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning networks. 
  - These models are trained on large amounts of data in a specific domain (e.g., text, images, video) and can then generate new outputs based on the patterns and features they have learned.

Some common examples of generative AI technologies include:

- Chatbots and virtual tutors: AI-driven chatbots can provide personalized tutoring, answering student questions and offering explanations on a wide range of subjects.

- Content creation tools: Tools like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can assist in creating educational content, generating lecture notes, or drafting exam questions based on certain criteria.

- Automated essay scoring and feedback: AI models can grade essays and provide feedback to students on their writing.

## How Do AI Tools Work?

- Basic principles of machine learning and AI
- Specifics of generative models (e.g., GPT, DALL-E)

## Who develops generative AI tools

- Generative AI technologies are often developed by publicly traded companies with:
    - Deep pockets
    - Shareholders
    - Motives and goals that may diverge from academic or public interests

- These technologies also require significant computing resources for training and operation
  - This skews access and development to those with substantial resources.

- The energy consumption required for training large models contributes to carbon emissions. 
  - There is already a larger than necessary hidden carbon footprint


  
# Impact of generative AI

## Impact on education / stages of AI grief

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
There is a finite number of options:

1. **Ignore** the existence of generative AI
2. **Forbid** the use of generative AI
3. **Circumnavigate** generative AI by using offline assessment modes like pen/paper exams or oral exams
4. **Test around** Let students perform tasks that generative AI struggles with
5. **Embrace** generative AI and allow it in course work
6. **Rethink** the way we assess students and develop new assessment methodologies

# Could it be
That defined learning goals, evaluations and skills are not aligned with our student's professional needs?

## AI in assessment
It is crucial to think about proper assessment designs for an AI-enabled student body. 

Here are some links that I find useful:

## Impact of AI on Cognitive Performance

- Overview of current research findings
- Case studies

## Impact on society
- There is also a societal impact of generative AI technologies 
  - They can create divides an inequality
  - There is [evidence](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) that the workers who curate these models are treated unfairly or even inhumanely by their employers. This [interview from today](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2024/03/25/madhumita-murgia-ai-can-do-harm-when-people-dont-have-a-voice/) also paints a good picture of how and where AI work can harm people.

# Policy

## Current
- [UU policy](https://intranet.uu.nl/generatieve-ai-in-het-onderwijs/generatieve-ai-faq)
- [UMCU: Guidelines for GSLS students](https://students.uu.nl/en/gsls/practical-information/generative-ai-guidelines)
- [UMCU: GenAI guidelines for research projects for students and supervisors](https://students.uu.nl/sites/default/files/GSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines%20for%20Students%20and%20SupervisorsGSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines.pdf)

## Towards responsible genAI use
I believe that we should demand from the UU community to follow these simple steps when using generative AI tools:

1. Minimize the use of AI tools, as they are (currently) environmentally unfriendly
2. Don't input confidential or personal information
3. Don't input information that violates IP or copyright
4. Don't violate IP with using output from the tool
5. Confirm the output accuracy
6. Check the tool output for bias
7. Disclose the use of AI tools in your work
8. Don't do naughty or unjust things with AI tools
9. Ask the tool not to use input for training
10. Open the content you produce by using AI tools as much as possible with permissive licenses

If in doubt about any of the above, don't use generative AI tools.

For teachers: Put a disclaimer on your materials that governs what is or is not allowed when using generative AI tools.

# Promises that have been made

## Enhancing Learning with AI

- Examples of positive impacts on learning and cognition

## AI and Accessibility in Education

- Making education more inclusive with AI

# How Students and Teachers Use AI output

## Students and Teachers: Expected Uses of AI

- Hypothetical benefits and applications in teaching and learning

## Reality Check: How AI Tools Are Actually Used

## Some general UU survey results
- 1633 Students
- 348 Teaching staff
- BA/MA balanced; few pre-master
- 34.4% of teaching staff report not to use GenAl for educational purposes vs. only 13.4% of students
- 68% of students use genAl for working with texts vs. 47% of staff
- Many students tend to use genAI to summarize texts or publications.

## Some interesting results
- Students see staff as `uninformed`, while staff sees students as `uninformed`.
- There is a huge cry for literacy training in GenAl from both students and staff. 
- 7.1% of teaching staff report that they use it for grading/assessment of work (no significant differences between faculties detected)
